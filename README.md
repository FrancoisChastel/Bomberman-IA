# Prolog project
### Presentation
Project made during INSA Lyon's studies for AI. The project aims to develop an IA on Bomberman.

## Getting started
### Requirements
You need to have a recent version of SWIPL installed. Have a look on the [official website](http://www.swi-prolog.org).
### Execution 
First, you need to clone this repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/FrancoisChastel/Bomberman-IA.git
```
After this, you can have execute the tests by going in the dir test and executing the script test.sh 
```shell
cd Bomberman-IA
.test/test.sh
```

If everything is ok, you can now run our bomberman by executing run.sh in the core dir, and after that open a browser and have a look on [localhost (port: 8080)](http://localhost:8080)
```shell
.core/run.sh
```
Now you can play ;)
